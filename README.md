# codingDojoWebFundamentals
Each project within WebFundamentals is within its own folder.  This removes the submodules and still keeps all organization simple and effective.  External stylesheets and scripts are named identically to the html file it supports to avoid confusion.  

When turning in assignments, they are zipped together in a folder with minor changes to ensure functionality.
