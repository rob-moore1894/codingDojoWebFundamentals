        <h1>Concussions and CTE in Professional Wrestling</h1>
        <img src="../img/chairshot.jpg" alt="picture of Rob Moore">

        <p>For the non-fan or those that don't follow professional wrestling, being hit in the head with a metal chair is just the thing that happens in professional wrestling... right?! Sure... that happened... back then. Jump to the current climate of the professional wrestling world with companies such as <a href="https://www.wwe.com/" target="_blank">WWE</a>, and <a href="https://www.allelitewrestling.com/" target="_blank">AEW</a>, and you may be surprised to know that the unprotected chair shot is highly discouraged and clearly taboo. Just like football, hockey, MMA, and other high impact sports professional wrestling also grew through the concussion and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) era. During this time, medical professionals began to discover and understand that repeated concussions lead to irreparable damage.</p>
